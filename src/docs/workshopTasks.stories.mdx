# Stuff to try out

1. Header has to be repeated for every view. Figure out a way around that and update the stories!
2. Create a `Select` component and stories for it. See `Button` component example on how to wrap a html component.
3. Publish your Storybook to GitHub pages. See: [pipeline](https://dev.to/kouts/deploy-storybook-to-github-pages-3bij)
   and [npm package](https://medium.com/swlh/how-to-deploy-storybook-to-github-pages-4894097d49ab)

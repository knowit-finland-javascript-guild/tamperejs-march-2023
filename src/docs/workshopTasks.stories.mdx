# Stuff to try out

1. Header has to be included in every view. Figure out a way around that and update the stories!
2. Create a `Select` component and stories for it. See `Button` component example on how to wrap a html component.
3. Publish your Storybook to GitHub pages. See: [pipeline](https://dev.to/kouts/deploy-storybook-to-github-pages-3bij)
   and [npm package](https://medium.com/swlh/how-to-deploy-storybook-to-github-pages-4894097d49ab)
4. Add components from your own project and see what the automated accessibility audits say about them
5. After adding your own components write some interactions tests for them
6. Add the [Test Runner](https://storybook.js.org/addons/@storybook/test-runner) to your Storybook and automate the testing
7. Add [Visual Testing](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/writing-tests/visual-testing) for your component

# Super secret notes to self

1. Visual Testing

- Check Chromatic https://www.chromatic.com/build?appId=63e1fd8cff45f0eab46abc01
- I used CLI, run a single command to compile Storybook, take screenshots and upload them to the web ui
- In real projects integrate to CI/CD pipeline

2. Interaction & accessibility testing + basic controls

- Show both sign up pages from the code
- Check sign up page with internal state
- Show the story configurations

3. Sign up page with internal state

- Pros:
  - Less props - cleaner interface
  - Most likely the way you intuitively write components
- Cons:
  - Only works for simple pages

4. Sign up page without internal state

- Pros:
  - Great at separating complexity
    - Passwords checked against most common passwords
    - Password matching could be lifted up and delay added to it without cluttering the component
    - Usage data gathered, how many people quit signing up at certain points
  - Clean workflow - Interface --> Story --> UI
- Cons:
  - Lots of props even now - what about with localizations or more complex components
  - Extra effort for an interactive story and interaction testing

5. Other things to note

- Both pages required an onSignup function as a prop
  - Could be imported to any project necessary
- Visual regression testing makes sure that changes to components don't accidentally modify the UI
- We got basic accessibility testing with very little effort
- We didn't get a chance to talk about a lot of things
  - Versioning
  - Package distributing
    - Public NPM
    - Privately hosted NPM
    - Bit.dev
  - Monorepo vs polyrepo
  - Adding props vs creating a new component
  - Design Systems
  - Communicating with other teams using the components

# Super secret notes to self

1. Controls

- Controls in Button
- URL parameters

2. Accessibility

- Contrast in Primary button
- Page Accessibility Violations

3. Interaction testing (Interactions Button)

- Uses React Testing library
- What happens with manual testing
- One `play` per story
- Manual controls

4. Visual Testing

- Check Chromatic https://www.chromatic.com/build?appId=63e1fd8cff45f0eab46abc01
- CLI, run a single command to compile Storybook, take screenshots and upload them to the web ui

5. Sign up page with internal state

- Pros:
  - Less props - cleaner interface
  - Most likely the way you intuitively write components
- Cons:
  - Only works for simple pages

6. Sign up page without internal state

- Pros:
  - Great at hiding complexity
    - Duplicate usernames might be checked on an interval
    - Passwords checked against most common passwords
    - Usage data gathered, how many people quit signing up at certain points
  - Clean workflow - Interface --> Story --> UI
- Cons:
  - Lots of props even now - what about with localizations
  - Extra effort for an interactive story
  - Extra effort for interaction testing

7. Other things to note

- Both pages required an onSignup function as a prop
- Both pages could be imported to any project necessary
- Visual regression testing makes sure that changes to components don't accidentally modify the UI
- We got basic accessibility testing basically for free
- We didn't get a chance to talk about a lot of things
  - Versioning
  - Package distributing
  - Monorepo vs independent repos
  - Adding props vs creating a new component
  - Design Systems
  - Communicating with other teams using the components
